# Site SEO/GEO Instructions (2026)

Working spec for auditing and updating developer-hosted sites for AI search visibility (Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) alongside traditional SEO. Use this as a checklist/prompt basis in Cursor — treat each section as a task to verify or implement.

---

## 0. Crawler Access (do this first — blocks everything else if wrong)

**Do not treat “AI bots” as one bucket.** Training crawlers and search/retrieval crawlers are separate user-agents. Blocking training is often fine; blocking search/retrieval removes you from AI citations.

### 0a. Allow — search / retrieval / citation (must not be disallowed)

Confirm these are **Allowed** in `robots.txt` (and not blocked at the CDN/WAF):

- [ ] OpenAI: `OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`
- [ ] Anthropic: `Claude-SearchBot`, `Claude-User`
- [ ] Perplexity: `PerplexityBot`, `Perplexity-User`
- [ ] Amazon: `Amzn-SearchBot` (Alexa/Rufus search — distinct from `Amazonbot`)

### 0b. Decide per site — training / corpus (default: Disallow)

These collect for model training or open corpora. Disallowing them does **not** remove you from classic Google Search. Default recommendation for most sites: **Disallow**. Allow only if you explicitly want maximum training exposure.

- [ ] OpenAI: `GPTBot` (training — not ChatGPT search)
- [ ] Anthropic: `ClaudeBot` (training — not Claude search)
- [ ] Google: `Google-Extended` (Gemini / AI-training control token — distinct from `Googlebot`; disallowing it does not hurt Search rankings)
- [ ] Apple: `Applebot-Extended` (foundation-model training — distinct from standard `Applebot`)
- [ ] Common Crawl: `CCBot`
- [ ] Amazon: `Amazonbot` (may train — distinct from `Amzn-SearchBot`)

### 0c. Edge / non-compliant

- [ ] `Bytespider` (ByteDance): block at **WAF/IP**, not only via `robots.txt` — compliance is inconsistent. Do not keep it open for “AI visibility.”
- [ ] If using Cloudflare or another CDN/WAF: check dashboard-level bot rules separately from `robots.txt`. A blanket “block AI bots” edge rule overrides a permissive `robots.txt` and can silently kill citation crawlers from 0a.
- [ ] Check server/access logs for crawl activity from the **0a** user agents to confirm they are really getting through.
- [ ] Confirm no important content is gated behind login, paywall, or interactive-only elements (modals, tabs that require JS click to reveal content).

## 1. Rendering & Indexing (GitHub Pages / static hosting)

- [ ] All pages are statically generated or pre-rendered (SSG) — no content that only appears after client-side JS execution. AI crawlers largely do not execute JS.
- [ ] Custom domain has HTTPS enforced.
- [ ] Explicit `<link rel="canonical">` on every page (avoid duplicate content across `.github.io` and custom domain).
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` present, current, and referenced in `robots.txt`.
- [ ] `robots.txt` and sitemap validated (no stale/broken URLs).

## 2. Icons & Link-Preview Images

Missing/incorrect icon tags are why some sites show a blank/generic square when shared or when found in Google's site listing. Cover both favicon (browser tab) and social/search preview images (link cards) — they're separate systems with separate requirements.

- [ ] `favicon.ico` (multi-size ICO, 16×16/32×32/48×48) at site root `/favicon.ico` — still the fallback browsers and some crawlers check by default even with no `<link>` tag.
- [ ] `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any">` in `<head>`.
- [ ] At least one modern PNG favicon (48×48 is fine; 16×16/32×32 optional):
  - `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="48x48" href="/favicon-48.png">`
  - Optional: `favicon-32x32.png` / `favicon-16x16.png`
- [ ] `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">` — used for iOS home-screen bookmarks and some link previews.
- [ ] `site.webmanifest` (or `manifest.json`) with `icons` array (192×192 and 512×512) — nice-to-have for Android/Chrome “add to home screen” / PWA; not a GEO ranking requirement. Reference: `<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">`.
- [ ] `theme-color` meta tag matching brand color: `<meta name="theme-color" content="#xxxxxx">`.

### 2a. og:image — this is the one most likely to be missing on your sites

This single tag is what determines the preview image on Google's own "rich" listing/knowledge display in some cases, plus iMessage, Slack, LinkedIn, Facebook, and WhatsApp link shares. A missing or broken `og:image` is the most common cause of a blank/generic box on link share — separate issue from the favicon, and easy to have fixed one without the other.

Required tags, every page, in `<head>`:
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Exact page title">
<meta property="og:description" content="1-2 sentence page summary">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/images/og/page-slug.png">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourdomain.com/page-slug">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/images/og/page-slug.png">
```

Checklist:
- [ ] `og:image` URL is **absolute** (`https://yourdomain.com/...`), never relative (`/images/og.png`) — relative paths silently fail on most crawlers.
- [ ] Image is a real JPG/PNG file, not SVG — most link-preview crawlers won't render SVG.
- [ ] Image is 1200×630px (standard OG ratio ~1.91:1) and under ~1MB.
- [ ] Also set `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` explicitly — some crawlers (notably older Facebook/LinkedIn scrapers) skip the image entirely without these.
- [ ] Prefer a distinct `og:image` per high-value page (home, each product/service, each demo vertical) — not one sitewide default reused everywhere. A shared default is acceptable as a floor; unique images for key URLs are the upgrade.
- [ ] Confirm the image file is actually present in the deployed build output — on GitHub Pages/static builds it's common for an `og-images/` folder to exist in source but not get copied into the publish directory.
- [ ] After fixing, force a re-scrape (previews are cached per-URL and won't update on their own):
  - Facebook Sharing Debugger — paste URL, click "Scrape Again"
  - LinkedIn Post Inspector — same, forces LinkedIn's cache to refresh
  - Twitter Card Validator
  - iMessage/WhatsApp previews are the hardest to force-refresh — may just need time, or a version-tagged image URL (`og-image.png?v=2`) to bust the cache.
- [ ] Test actual rendering, not just tag presence — code inspection alone misses broken paths:
  - Google: search `site:yourdomain.com` and check the favicon shown next to the listing (can take time to update/recrawl).
  - Rich Results Test / URL Inspection in Google Search Console for favicon eligibility issues (Google has specific size/squareness rules for favicons to show in search results — non-square or too-small icons get dropped).
  - Facebook Sharing Debugger, LinkedIn Post Inspector, and Twitter Card Validator for OG image previews (also force a re-scrape if a stale/blank preview was cached from before the fix).

## 3. llms.txt

`llms.txt` is an inference-time **navigation** aid. It does **not** control crawl access or training opt-out — that is `robots.txt` (+ WAF). Do not confuse the two.

- [ ] Publish `/llms.txt` at domain root. Emerging convention (not a confirmed ranking factor, but low-cost signal) — plain-text/Markdown file pointing AI systems to your most important, cleanest pages. Structure:
  - Site/brand name + one-line description
  - Links to key pages (services, products, demos, about, contact) with a one-line description each
  - Optional: link to a clean Markdown version of long-form pages if the HTML is heavy
- [ ] Do not rely on any auto-generated default `llms.txt` from a host/platform — it'll be generic and indistinguishable from competitors. Write it manually per site.

## 4. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

- [ ] `Organization` and/or `LocalBusiness` schema on homepage (name, URL, logo, social profiles, legal name) — use the type that matches the business.
- [ ] `Product` schema for physical products; `SoftwareApplication` for each app/demo/tool hosted on the site.
- [ ] `LocalBusiness` + `Service` + `GeoCoordinates` schema for any local-business client sites — one distinct page per service and per location, not a single combined page. Skip `GeoCoordinates` if there is no stable public storefront address.
- [ ] `FAQPage` schema for FAQ content — each answer must be a complete, standalone response (no "see above").
- [ ] `HowTo` schema for any procedural/step content.
- [ ] `Person`/portfolio schema where relevant for personal sites.

## 5. Content Strategy

- [ ] Audit existing pages: flag anything that's generic "how-to"/boilerplate rehashing content available elsewhere. Deprioritize or cut.
- [ ] For content to keep or add, it must include at least one of: proprietary data, a working first-party tool/calculator/demo, a real case study, or a distinct expert take not found elsewhere.
- [ ] Reformat content for extraction:
  - Lead each section with a direct, standalone answer (1–2 sentences) before supporting detail.
  - Clean heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3), one topic per section.
  - Use tables, numbered steps, and bullet lists over long prose blocks.
  - Phrase key headings as actual questions where natural.
- [ ] Add a freshness/update pass cadence for evergreen pages — stale pages lose ground to recently updated ones in AI retrieval.

## 6. Local Business Client Sites (if applicable)

- [ ] Website structure mirrors the client's Google Business Profile exactly — matching service names, categories, and locations.
- [ ] One dedicated page per service × per location (no combined "services" list page).
- [ ] Copy explicitly names specific services and outcomes matching how customers phrase reviews/prompts (e.g., "emergency tankless water heater repair in [City]") — pull language directly from real reviews where possible.
- [ ] `LocalBusiness`/`Service`/`GeoCoordinates` schema implemented in the static build, not injected client-side only.

## 7. Off-Site Authority (not on-page, but required)

- [ ] Identify opportunities for mentions in other authoritative sites/publications, relevant directories, and (where applicable) Wikipedia/Wikidata — brand-mention frequency across the web correlates with AI citation frequency.
- [ ] Maintain accurate, consistent brand info across all external profiles (name, description, links) — inconsistency undermines entity matching.

## 8. Branded Demand / Diversification

- [ ] Track branded search volume (client name / app name searches) as a KPI, not just generic keyword rank.
- [ ] Maintain at least one non-search channel per client (YouTube, social, email list) so visibility isn't 100% dependent on any single engine.

## 9. Measurement

- [ ] Set up manual or tool-based tracking of AI citations — Search Console does not capture this. Periodically query ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude with real target prompts and log which pages/competitors get cited.
- [ ] Track AI bot crawl activity in server logs over time, separate from human traffic — and separate **0a retrieval** agents from **0b training** agents.

---

**Priority order if doing this incrementally:** Section 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 5 → 6/7/8 → 9. Access, rendering, and icon fixes are quick wins with immediate visible payoff; content/schema work is higher effort. Both are wasted if citation crawlers (0a) can't reach the site at all — or if a WAF is silently blocking them while `robots.txt` looks fine.
